# Machine Learning Lab  

This repository contains a collection of lab exercises, practical assignments, and projects designed to help learners understand and apply various machine learning concepts. Each exercise focuses on specific algorithms, techniques, or tasks commonly encountered in machine learning.  



## Features  

This repository includes:  
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practical tasks for supervised and unsupervised learning methods.  
- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Instructions and code to implement machine learning algorithms.  
- **Theoretical Insights**: Brief explanations of the concepts behind each task.  
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs to aid understanding of results.  


## Prerequisites  

To run the exercises, you need:  
- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE  
- Required Libraries:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn  

Install dependencies with:  
```bash  
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn  
```  


## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ashithapallath/Machine-Learning.git
